  How I saved months of development time on an idea that wouldn't work

This is a story that saved me months of development time and it's all thanks to
interviewing potential customers. After interviewing them I realized that the
problem has already been solved, just not in the way I originally would have
thought.

This blog article describes my process for discovering that the product idea
wasn't worth my time or energy. I hope by the end of this article others will
see the value in interviewing customers before writing a single line of code.

## What was the problem?

After building [my previous app](https://listifi.app), I wanted to approach my
next product a little differently. Instead of coming up with an idea and
spending months building something based on a hunch, I wanted to spend some time
upfront to figure out if the problem resonated with people.

I spent some time coming up with new problems that I could solve. The idea I
kept coming back to was this one:

> Figuring out where I put notes, docs, information in various apps requires
> active knowledge about where I stored it.

I thought this problem was interesting and one I could potentially solve with
software. I don't like memorizing where I stored information, I just want to
perform an automated search to find where my information is stored. I thought
this was an interesting idea to explore. It met all of my personal product idea
criteria:

- It solves a real problem I have
- I could build a prototype in a month or so of my time
- I could potentially charge users to purchase the product immediately

Normally when I come up with a product idea, my first inclination is to start
building. The thought is "I'll validate the product once people can try it."
Instead, I decided to find people who really enjoy organizing their notes and
ideas into various productivity apps and see if they have the same problem I
have.

## Finding people to interview

My first step was to find online communities that like using productivity apps
and enjoy organizing their ideas. I found a couple of subreddits that met that
criteria. Then I messaged a few people that were active in those communities
that would be interested in having a conversation with me about their workflows.

I tried to make the conversations friendly and direct with a probing question
about their workflows. I found this to be effective because I was pleasantly
surprised by how many people wanted to chat about this problem.

I asked a few questions to get the topic closer to the problem I was trying to
understand:

- Do you ever struggle to remember where you put a note, doc, or some other
  piece of information in the various apps you use?
- Do you use an app to solve this problem?Â  If so, what is it?
- What if there was a tool to help search for your information, would you find
  something like that useful?
- What if your employer adopted this tool, allowing you to search for any notes,
  docs the company created, would you find this tool useful?

## Results of the interviews

After messaging a few people asking them if they struggled to find information
they had written in various apps, here were the results:

- 4 people did **not** have this problem
- 4 people did have this problem

As I started to dig deeper into how each of them addressed the problem of
retrieving information they stored somewhere, I uncovered that the ones who
solved the problem had an organizational system for cataloging data. The ones
that struggled with this problem also tried to solve it with organizational
solutions.

Most people during this interview mentioned either `Evernote` or `Notion`. Ah!
As I started to investigate, it sounded like most people chose to store all
their information in one central location and make it a priority to keep it
organized. They have workflows that involve cataloging their data into one app.
If they use other apps, then they end up making references to that data inside
something like `Evernote`.

The people that never have this problem make it a point to only use a couple
apps that can handle most of their organization or note writing needs.

So the problem is real, but people are solving it in a relatively easy way. I
also noticed that the way I asked the questions led them to agreeing with my
premise, which is a problem.

## What did I learn?

I learned that people solve this problem already using very popular apps. I
learned that the problem I thought was important, was very small compared to the
other note taking problems these apps are solving. After my investigation, I
felt like the problem has effectively been solved by other apps on the market
and my solution wasn't as profound as I thought.

> About It -- [Daniel Kahneman](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11984)

After discussing my customer interviews with a colleague, another important
lesson I learned was that my line of questioning was _leading the witness_. I
presented the problem too plainly and forced the customer to focus on the
problem and buy into the solution I envisioned. Some people were "interested" in
the imaginary tool I was thinking about building, but that doesn't mean they
would actually use it when it was built.

### What questions should I have asked?

I wanted to get them to talk about the problem I was trying to solve instead of
asking them what problems they have with staying organized and writing notes in
multiple apps. I think these conversations are a dance.

> I want them to confess the problem I'm investigating without directly asking
> them if it's a problem.

So I think reframing the questions could have gotten me better answers and
possibly led me to uncovering other problems:

- How do you stay organized using multiple productivity apps?
- What are some problems you have staying organized?
- Could you stack rank your problems in terms of significance?
- How do you stay organized at work when the company uses different tools to
  organize notes, docs, and information?
- Do you pay for any existing note taking service?

In the end, this was another valuable learning experience. Ultimately I got to
the answer I wanted: this product wasn't worth building. But, because my line of
questioning was nudging the interviewee to agree with me, I could have easily
made the decision to pursue building this product.

## Conclusion

I went into these interviews with a set of questions that led the customer where
I wanted them to go. Like with any good survey, the way the questions are
structured are critically important. I'm learning a lot because of the mistakes
I'm making, and it's energizing me to continue down this path of talking to
people.

This exercise of performing customer interviews was eye opening: creating a
product in a vacuum is a major reason why my products have _not_ been
successful. I'm figuring this out by saving hundreds of hours in product
development. I learn through experience, so it seems obvious now why product
managers interview customers constantly, but it wasn't obvious to me until
recently.

**These customer interviews killed my product idea and I couldn't be happier
about it.**
