  How I saved months of development time on an idea that wouldn't work

This is a story that saved me months of development time and it's all thanks to
interviewing potential customers. The short answer is it's a solved problem,
just not in the way I originally thought.

This blog article describes my process to discovering that my product idea
wasn't worth my time or energy. I hope by the end of this article others will
see the value in interviewing customers before writing a single line of code.

## What was the problem?

After building [my previous app](https://listifi.app), I wanted to approach my
next product a little differently. Instead of coming up with an idea and
spending months building a product to solve a problem I had a hunch people had,
I wanted to spend some time upfront to figure out if the problem is legitimate.

I spent some time coming up with new problems that I could solve. The idea I
kept coming back to was this:

> Figuring out where I put notes, docs, information in various apps requires
> active knowledge about where I stored it.

I thought this problem was interesting and one I could potentially solve with
software. I don't like memorizing where I stored information, I just want
perform an automated search to find where my information is stored. I thought
this was an interesting idea to explore. It met all of my product idea criteria:

- It solves a real problem I have
- I could build a prototype in a month or so of my time
- I could potentially charge users to purchase the product

Normally when I come up with a product idea, my first inclination is to start
building. Instead, I decided to find people who really enjoy organizing their
notes and ideas into various productivity apps and see if they have the same
problem I have.

## Finding people to interview

My first step was to find online communities that like using productivity apps
and enjoy organizing their ideas. I found a couple of subreddits that met that
criteria. Then I messaged a few people that were active in those communities
that would be interested in having a conversation with me about their workflows.

I tried to make the conversations friendly and direct with a probing question
about their workflows. I found this to be effective because I was pleasantly
surprised by how many people wanted to chat about this problem.

I asked a few probing questions to get the topic closer to the problem I was
trying to understand:

- Do you ever struggle to remember where you put a note, doc, or some other
  piece of information in the various apps you use?
- Do you use an app to solve this problem?Â  If so, what is it?
- What if there was a tool to help search for your information, would you find
  something like that useful?
- What if you employer adopted this tool, allowing you to search for any notes,
  docs the company created, would you find this tool useful?

## Results of the interviews

After messaging a few people asking them if they struggled to find information
they had written in various apps, here were the results:

- 4 people did not have this problem
- 4 people struggled with this problem

As I started to dig deeper into how each of them addressed the problem of
retrieving the information they had stored, I uncovered that the ones who solved
the problem had an organizational solution. The ones that struggled with this
problem still today also tried to solve with organizational solutions.

Most people during this interview mentioned either `Evernote` or `Notion`. Ah!
As I started to investigate, it sounded like most people choose to store all
their information in one central location and make it a priority to keep it
organized. They have workflows that involve cataloging their data into one app.
If they use other apps, then end up making referencing inside something like
`Evernote`.

The people that never have this problem make it a point to only use a couple
apps that can handle most of their organization or note writing needs.

## What did I learn?

I learned that people solve this problem already using very popular apps. I
learned that the problem I thought was important, was very small compared to the
other note taking problems these apps are solving. After my investigation, I
felt like the problem has effectively been solved by other apps on the market
and my solution wasn't as profound as I thought.

After discussing my customer interviews with a colleague, another important
lesson I learned was that my line of questioning was leading the witness. I
presented the problem too plainly and forced the "customer" to focus on the
problem and buy into the solution I envisioned. Some people were "interested" in
the imaginary tool I was thinking about building, but that doesn't mean they
would actually use it when it was built.

### What questions should I have asked?

I wanted to get them to talk about the problem I was trying to solve instead of
asking them what problems they have with staying organized and productive. I
wanted the customer to tell me they have a problem finding where they put notes
without me asking directly.

- How do you stay organized using multiple producitivity apps?
- What are some big problems you have with staying organized?
- Do you work at a company where you need to access notes, docs across multiple
  apps?
- If so, how do you stay organized?

In the end, this was another valuable learning experience. Ultimately I got to
the answer I wanted: this product wasn't worth building. But, because my line of
questioning was begging the interviewee to agree with me, I could have easily
made the decision to pursue building this product.

## Conclusion

I went into these interviews with a set of questions that led the customer where
I wanted them to go. Like with any good survey, the way the questions are
structured are critically important. I'm learning a lot because of the mistakes
I'm making, and it's energizing me to continue to think of products to build.

This exercise of performing customer interviews was eye opening: creating a
product in a vacuum is a major reason why my product ideas aren't successful.
I'm figuring this out by saving hundreds of hours in product development. I feel
like I learned about a life hack that product managers have known for decades.

**These customer interviews killed my product idea and I couldn't be happier
about it.**
